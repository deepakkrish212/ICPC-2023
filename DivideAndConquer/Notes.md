# Steps to solve a problem using Divide and Conquer

- Divide the problem into subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
- Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner.
- Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
